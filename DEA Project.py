# <span style='color: black ; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1em'> The banking sector has always been a very attractive area for economic research 
# and studies. Calculating the operational efficiency of branches in a bank is 
# important for several reasons:
#     
# 1. Identifying areas for improvement: By measuring the efficiency of 
# different branches, the bank can identify areas where operations could be 
# improved. For example, a branch with low efficiency could be targeted for 
# process improvements or staff training.
#     
# 2. Optimizing resource allocation: Understanding which branches are 
# performing well and which are not can help the bank allocate resources 
# more effectively. For instance, if a branch is operating efficiently, the bank 
# may choose to invest more in marketing or other growth initiatives for that 
# branch.
#     
# 3. Benchmarking: Comparing the performance of different branches against 
# each other and against industry benchmarks can provide valuable insights 
# into best practices and areas where the bank can improve.
#     
# In this project we explore the branches of Central Bank of India by calculating
# its efficiency. We compare efficiency and productivity growth differentials in 
# order to understand which branches were better performers. As a method of study,
# we adopt Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. DEA models are 
# extensively used for analysing banking firms. Their advantage is the ability to 
# incorporate multiple inputs and multiple outputs as well as various forms of 
# constraints. DEA has been used extensively in studies of the banking industry in 
# developed and developing economies; for individual countries as well as crosscountry comparisons (Aly et al., 1990; Chen, 1998; Sathye, 2001; Casu & 
# Girardone, 2006; Moffat & Valadkhani, 2011).
# Though this framework does not require profit maximization assumption and 
# does not explicitly account for the market structure, it proved to give meaningful 
# results and to serve its purpose to give the estimation of â€˜who does better'

#                            Input Factors
# 1. Operating Staffs: - Operating staffs in a bank are responsible for carrying 
# out the day-to-day operations of the bank. They are the backbone of the 
# bank and play a critical role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the 
# bank's operations. They are the face of the bank for most customers and are 
# responsible for building and maintaining strong relationships with 
# customers.
# 2. Operating Cost: - It includes the overall cost to operate a particular branch 
# and includes costs like rent.
# 3. Total Number of ATMs, Kiosks, Passbook Printers: - ATMs and other 
# electronic machines are used for making deposits and bank spend a large 
# amount of resource in order to operate them.
# 4. Premises Area: - Premises data is used as an input because it is a measure 
# of the physical size of the branch and can provide insights into its capacity 
# to serve customers and carry out transactions. Using floor space as an input 
# in DEA can provide insights into the efficiency of a bank branch and help 
# identify areas for improvement.
#     
#                         Output Factors
# 1. Total number of new Accounts Opened (Savings and Current): - A
# branch that is able to open a large number of new accounts relative to its 
# inputs may be considered more efficient than a branch that is only able to 
# open a small number of accounts with the same inputs.
# 2. Total Amount deposited: - It is the total sum of amount deposited in a 
# given branch for the financial year 2022-2023.

# <span style='color: black ; font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1em'> In this project the efficiency of Central Bank of India under the Gandhinagar region was evaluated. Our analysis focused on the relative evaluation of performance of 
# branches. 
#     
# As a method of study, we used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA models 
# have been extensively used for analysing bank branches. Their advantage is the 
# ability to incorporate multiple inputs and multiple outputs as well as various 
# forms of constraints. 
#     
# At first, we used the CCR model and found that 11 branches of the bank were 
# efficient and the other 11 were inefficient. Next, we used the BCC model which 
# gave us 14 efficient branches and 8 inefficient ones. Later, to rank the already 
# efficient branches we used the concept of super efficiency. For super efficiency
# model, we used Anderson and Peterson model on our CCR model.
# Calculating efficiency of branches is an interesting phenomenon for a banking 
# sector to optimise their means of resources. Many inputs are reduced by firms 
# (makes banks more efficient, make them squeeze their resource usage).
